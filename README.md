# Implementation of a Simple Swarm Engine

Swarm are naturally observed in insects and animals, where the individual activity
are suppressed by the group will. 

An example is the Ant Swarm process. Ants use a process of hdei...pheromone

Other example are the Bee Swarm, bees are separated in three classes... SOo when a .. be find a new and fresh food source,
it is checked by the.... and if have better "pontuation" 

--> Escrever um pouco sobre os insetos e animais que tem isso atuam na natureza.

We are using a simple 2D Physics simulator to act as our engine.
